# ML-based-Optimization-of-IRR-in-RF-mixer-circuits

The project is a web-based platform built using Flask that enables users to optimize the Image Rejection Ratio (IRR) of a Gilbert Cell Mixer using pre-executed Jupyter Notebooks.

## Key Features:
1) User Input: Upload IRR dataset and choose one of four application scenarios.

2) Notebook Execution: Based on user selection, the corresponding notebook is automatically run.

3) Output Extraction: The system extracts IRR (before and after), optimized Q-factor, and notch frequency from the notebook‚Äôs output JSON file.

4) Visualization: A bar chart displays IRR improvement, and optimized parameters are shown clearly on the interface.

5) Modular Setup: Each application has its own dedicated notebook and logic, making the system scalable and easy to maintain.

This project bridges hardware simulation with a user-friendly web interface, delivering accurate, fast, and visually interpretable IRR optimization.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **optimization of Image Rejection Ratio (IRR)** for a **Gilbert Cell Mixer** using AI/ML-assisted passive notch filter design. The IRR was optimized for four different applications: **Instrumentation, Radar, Satellite, and Wireless communication systems**. By processing HB analysis outputs from LTspice, the system significantly enhances the IRR and visualizes improvements.

## Observations

| Application      | Initial IRR (dB) | Optimized IRR (dB) |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Instrumentation  | 20               | 27                 |
| Radar            | 20               | 46                 |
| Satellite        | 20               | 52                 |
| Wireless         | 20               | 37                 |

- All applications saw a **minimum IRR gain of 7 dB**, with satellite showing the highest improvement.
- ML-based tuning of passive notch filters provided **precise optimization** without active circuit modifications.
- IRR enhancement was tailored for each application, ensuring robustness and adaptability.
